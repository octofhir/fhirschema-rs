# CLI Additional Kinds Support

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 0.5 Days  
**Actual Time:** 0.5 Days

## Overview
Fix the CLI to support converting all StructureDefinition kinds (resource, complex-type, primitive-type, logical) instead of only processing resources. The CLI was previously skipping "additional kinds" that the converter already supported.

## Issue Description
The CLI was filtering out StructureDefinitions with kinds other than "resource", causing complex-type, primitive-type, and logical StructureDefinitions to be skipped during bulk conversion operations.

## Root Cause
In the `download_and_convert` function in `src/bin/cli.rs`, there was explicit filtering that only allowed `kind="resource"`:

```rust
// Only process resource-level StructureDefinitions
if structure_def.kind != "resource" {
    skip_stats.not_resource_kind += 1;
    continue;
}
```

This contradicted the converter's capability to handle all supported kinds.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Filtering Logic ✓
Changed the filtering to allow all supported kinds:

```rust
// Process all supported StructureDefinition kinds
let supported_kinds = ["resource", "complex-type", "primitive-type", "logical"];
if !supported_kinds.contains(&structure_def.kind.as_str()) {
    skip_stats.unsupported_kind += 1;
    continue;
}
```

### 2. Updated Skip Statistics ✓
- Renamed `not_resource_kind` to `unsupported_kind` for clarity
- Updated all references throughout the code
- Updated the skip reason message to reflect the new behavior

### 3. Updated Error Messages ✓
Changed the skip reason message from:
```
"Only StructureDefinitions with kind='resource' are converted (skipped: primitive, complex-type, logical)"
```

To:
```
"Only StructureDefinitions with supported kinds are converted (supported: resource, complex-type, primitive-type, logical)"
```

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `src/bin/cli.rs`: Updated filtering logic and skip statistics

### Key Changes
1. **Line 366-371**: Updated filtering logic to support all kinds
2. **Line 336-342**: Renamed struct field from `not_resource_kind` to `unsupported_kind`
3. **Line 369**: Updated increment to use new field name
4. **Line 404**: Updated total calculation to use new field name
5. **Line 418-420**: Updated skip statistics output with new field name and message

## Testing
- ✅ Code compiles successfully with CLI features enabled
- ✅ All variable references updated correctly
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings

## Impact
The CLI now processes all supported StructureDefinition kinds:
- **resource**: Base resources and profiles
- **complex-type**: Complex data types (including Extensions)
- **primitive-type**: Primitive data types
- **logical**: Logical model definitions

This aligns the CLI behavior with the converter's capabilities and resolves the issue of skipping additional kinds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CLI processes complex-type StructureDefinitions
- [x] CLI processes primitive-type StructureDefinitions  
- [x] CLI processes logical StructureDefinitions
- [x] CLI continues to process resource StructureDefinitions
- [x] Skip statistics accurately reflect the new behavior
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Error messages are clear and accurate

## Dependencies
- Converter support for all kinds (already implemented)
- FhirSchema classification fields (already implemented)

## Notes
This fix ensures that the CLI utilizes the full capability of the converter, which already supported all these kinds through the classification logic implemented in previous work. The issue was purely in the CLI filtering logic, not in the underlying conversion capability.
