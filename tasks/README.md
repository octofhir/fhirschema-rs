# OctoFHIR FHIRSchema Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the detailed task breakdown for implementing the octofhir-fhirschema library based on [ADR-001](../adr/ADR-001-octofhir-fhirschema-implementation.md).

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized by phase and status:

- **`phase-*.md`** - Detailed task breakdowns for each implementation phase
- **`done/`** - Completed tasks (moved here when finished)
- **`in-progress/`** - Currently active tasks
- **`todo/`** - Pending tasks waiting to be started

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) ✓
**File:** [phase-1-foundation.md](done/phase-1-foundation.md)  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority:** High  

Set up project structure, core types, error handling, and build infrastructure.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Working Cargo project structure
- Core FhirSchema types with serde support
- Comprehensive error handling system
- Test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Converter Implementation (Week 2-3) ✓
**File:** [phase-2-converter.md](done/phase-2-converter.md)  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority:** High  

Implement StructureDefinition to FHIRSchema conversion with support for all FHIR modeling features.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete converter module
- Element transformation engine
- Choice type and slicing support
- Integration with octofhir-canonical-manager

### Phase 3: Validation Engine (Week 3-4) ✓
**File:** [phase-3-validator.md](completed/phase-3-validator.md)  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** High  

Implement FHIRSchema validation engine with support for all rule types.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete validation engine
- Support for all FHIRSchema rule types
- FHIRPath constraint evaluation
- Performance-optimized validation

### Phase 4: Golden Tests & Compatibility (Week 4-5)
**File:** [phase-4-golden-tests.md](todo/phase-4-golden-tests.md)  
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** High  

Port golden tests from reference implementation and ensure compatibility.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete golden test suite
- 100% compatibility with reference implementation
- Performance benchmarks
- Regression test infrastructure

### Phase 5: CLI Implementation & Polish (Week 5-6)
**File:** [phase-5-cli-polish.md](todo/phase-5-cli-polish.md)  
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** Medium  

Implement CLI tool and prepare library for publication.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete CLI implementation
- Comprehensive documentation
- Published crate on crates.io
- Usage examples and tutorials

## Task Management

### Moving Tasks
When starting a task:
1. Move the relevant task file to `in-progress/`
2. Update the status in the file header
3. Add start date and assignee

When completing a task:
1. Move the task file to `done/`
2. Update status to "DONE"
3. Add completion date and final notes

### Task Dependencies
Tasks should be completed in phase order, but within phases, some tasks can be done in parallel:

- Phase 1 must be completed before any other phase
- Phases 2 and 3 can overlap partially
- Phase 4 requires Phases 2 and 3 to be mostly complete
- Phase 5 requires all previous phases complete

### Progress Tracking
Track progress using the checkboxes in each phase file. Update regularly to maintain visibility into project status.

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
- [ ] All phase tasks are marked as done (3/5 phases complete)
- [ ] All golden tests pass with identical output to reference
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement over TypeScript
- [ ] Library is published to crates.io
- [ ] CLI tool is fully functional
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous phases
- Golden test compatibility is critical for success
- Performance should meet or exceed the TypeScript reference
- Library-first design with optional CLI feature
- Integration with octofhir-canonical-manager is essential
