# Phase 2: Converter Implementation

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 2 Weeks  

## Overview
Implement the core StructureDefinition to FHIRSchema conversion logic, including support for complex FHIR features like choice types, slicing, and constraints.

## Tasks

### 2.1 Basic Converter Infrastructure ✓

### 2.2 Element Transformation ✓

### 2.3 Choice Types Support ✓

### 2.4 Slicing Implementation ✓

### 2.5 Constraint Processing ✓

### 2.6 Reference Resolution ✓

### 2.7 Schema Storage Integration ✓

### 2.8 Advanced Features ✓

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Basic Patient StructureDefinition converts successfully
- [x] Choice types are properly expanded
- [x] Slicing rules are correctly implemented
- [x] All constraint types are supported
- [x] Reference resolution works with canonical manager
- [x] Conversion matches reference implementation output

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Foundation must be complete
- octofhir-canonical-manager integration
- Reference implementation golden tests

## Deliverables
- Complete converter module
- Element transformation engine
- Choice type and slicing support
- Constraint processing system
- Integration with canonical manager

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each conversion component
- Integration tests with real StructureDefinitions
- Golden test compatibility verification
- Performance benchmarks

## Notes
This is the most complex phase as it needs to handle all FHIR modeling complexities. Focus on getting the core conversion logic correct before optimizing for performance.
