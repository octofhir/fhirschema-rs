# Phase 1: Foundation

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 1 Week  

## Overview
Set up the basic project structure, core types, and development infrastructure for the octofhir-fhirschema library.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Project Setup ✓

### 1.2 Core Type Definitions ✓

### 1.3 Storage Infrastructure ✓

### 1.4 Error Handling ✓

### 1.5 Build Infrastructure ✓

### 1.6 Testing Foundation ✓

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Cargo.toml compiles with all features
- [x] All core types serialize/deserialize correctly
- [x] Storage interfaces are well-defined and tested
- [x] Memory storage and caching work correctly
- [x] Error types provide helpful messages
- [x] CI pipeline runs successfully
- [x] Basic tests pass

## Dependencies
- None (foundation phase)

## Deliverables
- Working Cargo project structure
- Core FhirSchema types with serde support
- Storage infrastructure (memory, cache, optional disk)
- Comprehensive error handling system
- Test infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent development. Focus on getting the structure right rather than implementing complex logic.
