They are also used when planning care of various kinds, and may be used for reporting the schedule to which past regular activities were carried out.","elements":{"event":{"type":"dateTime","array":true,"short":"When the event occurs","isSummary":true,"index":0},"repeat":{"type":"Element","short":"When the event is to occur","constraint":{"tim-6":{"expression":"periodMax.empty() or period.exists()","human":"If there's a periodMax, there must be a period","severity":"error"},"tim-7":{"expression":"durationMax.empty() or duration.exists()","human":"If there's a durationMax, there must be a duration","severity":"error"},"tim-4":{"expression":"duration.exists() implies duration >= 0","human":"duration SHALL be a non-negative value","severity":"error"},"tim-1":{"expression":"duration.empty() or durationUnit.exists()","human":"if there's a duration, there needs to be duration units","severity":"error"},"tim-8":{"expression":"countMax.empty() or count.exists()","human":"If there's a countMax, there must be a count","severity":"error"},"tim-5":{"expression":"period.exists() implies period >= 0","human":"period SHALL be a non-negative value","severity":"error"},"tim-2":{"expression":"period.empty() or periodUnit.exists()","human":"if there's a period, there needs to be period units","severity":"error"},"tim-10":{"expression":"timeOfDay.empty() or when.empty()","human":"If there's a timeOfDay, there cannot be a when, or vice versa","severity":"error"},"tim-9":{"expression":"offset.empty() or (when.exists() and ((when in ('C' | 'CM' | 'CD' | 'CV')).not()))","human":"If there's an offset, there must be a when (and not C, CM, CD, CV)","severity":"error"}},"elements":{"dayOfWeek":{"type":"code","array":true,"short":"mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun","binding":{"strength":"required","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/days-of-week|4.3.0","bindingName":"DayOfWeek"},"isSummary":true,"index":17},"count":{"type":"positiveInt","short":"Number of times to repeat","isSummary":true,"index":7},"bounds":{"short":"Length/Range of lengths, or (Start and/or end) limits","choices":["boundsDuration","boundsRange","boundsPeriod"],"isSummary":true,"index":3},"boundsPeriod":{"type":"Period","short":"Length/Range of lengths, or (Start and/or end) limits","choiceOf":"bounds","isSummary":true,"index":6},"period":{"type":"decimal","short":"Event occurs frequency times per period","isSummary":true,"index":14},"duration":{"type":"decimal","short":"How long when it happens","isSummary":true,"index":9},"boundsDuration":{"type":"Duration","short":"Length/Range of lengths, or (Start and/or end) limits","choiceOf":"bounds","isSummary":true,"index":4},"periodMax":{"type":"decimal","short":"Upper limit of period (3-4 hours)","isSummary":true,"index":15},"durationMax":{"type":"decimal","short":"How long when it happens (Max)","isSummary":true,"index":10},"when":{"type":"code","array":true,"short":"Code for time period of occurrence","binding":{"strength":"required","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/event-timing|4.3.0","bindingName":"EventTiming"},"isSummary":true,"index":19},"durationUnit":{"type":"code","short":"s | min | h | d | wk | mo | a - unit of time (UCUM)","binding":{"strength":"required","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/units-of-time|4.3.0","bindingName":"UnitsOfTime"},"isSummary":true,"index":11},"offset":{"type":"unsignedInt","short":"Minutes from event (before or after)","isSummary":true,"index":20},"periodUnit":{"type":"code","short":"s | min | h | d | wk | mo | a - unit of time (UCUM)","binding":{"strength":"required","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/units-of-time|4.3.0","bindingName":"UnitsOfTime"},"isSummary":true,"index":16},"frequency":{"type":"positiveInt","short":"Event occurs frequency times per period","isSummary":true,"index":12},"frequencyMax":{"type":"positiveInt","short":"Event occurs up to frequencyMax times per period","isSummary":true,"index":13},"timeOfDay":{"type":"time","array":true,"short":"Time of day for action","isSummary":true,"index":18},"boundsRange":{"type":"Range","short":"Length/Range of lengths, or (Start and/or end) limits","choiceOf":"bounds","isSummary":true,"index":5},"countMax":{"type":"positiveInt","short":"Maximum number of times to repeat","isSummary":true,"index":8}},"isSummary":true,"index":1},"code":{"type":"CodeableConcept","short":"BID | TID | QID | AM | PM | QD | QOD | +","binding":{"strength":"preferred","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/timing-abbreviation","bindingName":"TimingAbbreviation"},"isSummary":true,"index":21}}},"recipientType":{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqf-recipientType","version":"4.3.0","name":"recipientType","type":"Extension","kind":"complex-type","derivation":"constraint","base":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","abstract":false,"class":"extension","description":"The type of individual that will consume the response content.

A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.
